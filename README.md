# Python Challenge

I did a tutoring session and the tutor helped me figure out a lot of the code for the first part, and then for the second part, I mostly rehashed the code from the first part that would work, and then googled how dictionaries worked in python, because they are very confusing. I do not innately know how any of the syntax or any of the lingo works in python, so I did look up all of that on the internet.

I copied the formatting from the example on canvas so that the text would print out in the same way, but replaced with the numbers and stuff that I got with the code
